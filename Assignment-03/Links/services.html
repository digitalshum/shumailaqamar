    <h2 id="marketing">Marketing Planning Process for Professional Services:</h2>
    <p>Any professional services firm that wants to be profitable and grow needs a marketing plan. Without one, an
        organization has no systematic approach to promote itself to potential clients. The alternative is a haphazard,
        start-and-stop, do-marketing-when-you-can dog,s breakfast that wastes time and money—two resources no firm can
        afford to squander.

        However, not all marketing plans perform alike. A marketing planning process that works well for consumer
        products, industrial goods, or not-for-profits is not well suited for professional services. Buyers of
        professional services have unique characteristics and behaviors that demand a particular approach. What,s more,
        most professional services are expensive, so buyers take a much longer, more deliberate approach to selecting a
        firm.

        With these issues in mind, let,s take a look at what it takes to put together an effective marketing plan
        specifically for a professional services firm like yours.

        Of course, there,s more to a marketing plan than a list of ideas to promote your firm. You need to follow a
        specific process—one that produces a plan tailored to your needs and your team,s talents and limitations.

        Before we get into that process, however, let,s clarify a few key marketing planning concepts.</p>
