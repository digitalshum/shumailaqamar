    <h2>WordPress.org:</h2>
    <p>If you want to be in control of everything with your blog, from how it looks to what you post, then WordPress.org
        is the option for you. And while you can run your own server from your basement, it's a lot easier to use a
        hosting service (like Bluehost or Kinsta) that can automatically install WordPress for you. (Though maybe avoid
        WP Engine for now, because there's a heap of drama going down between it and WordPress founder, Matt Mullenweg.)

        Not only does WordPress make the basics easy to do, but it really is endlessly customizable. There are tens of
        thousands of themes and plugins that change how it looks and what it does. There are themes for photographers
        and designers to show off their work, plugins that let you sell products through your blog posts, and anything
        else you can imagine. It's a fairly wild world out there, but there is great community support that can help you
        navigate it.

        The downside of running your own WordPress installation is that, unless you pay for managed hosting or employ a
        developer, you really are on your own. While basic stuff like installing a theme is relatively simple,
        customizing it so that it looks good and works with your content may take a bit of Googling. Similarly, while
        blogging with WordPress is easy and the Gutenberg editor is great to use, adding extra functionality with a
        plugin and getting it to work with your setup isn't always user-friendly. Depending on what you're trying to do
        and your level of experience with web tools, you may find WordPress a cinch—or a bit of a nightmare.

        Still, the upsides of WordPress far outweigh the downsides. Even if you're starting from scratch, its
        peculiarities don't take that long to learn—and then you'll have a useful skill.</p>

    <h2>WordPress.com</h2>
    <p>WordPress.com is a hosted version of WordPress, run by the developers. It's super simple to get up and running.
        There are free accounts, but you have to pay to get anything close to the full customizability of the
        self-hosted version.

        Getting started is easy: head to WordPress.com, sign up for a free account, and within minutes, you can have a
        free blog with a .wordpress.com domain name (like harryszapiertestblog.wordpress.com) up and running. It'll be
        very basic, there are a limited number of themes to choose from (some of which you have to pay for), there are
        ads for WordPress.com displayed on your site, and you have no access to support staff.

        To move much beyond a basic blog with a .wordpress.com domain, you need to subscribe to a paid plan. The
        $9/month Personal plan lets you use your own domain name, removes ads, and gives you email support. You're still
        stuck with a limited number of basic themes unless you buy a premium theme or pay for the $18/month Premium
        plan, which grants you access to more themes and styling options. It's not until you pay for the $40/month
        Business plan or $70/month eCommerce plan that you can upload and use third-party themes and plugins, like you
        can with your own WordPress server.

        If you've ever used the self-hosted version of WordPress, you'll be right at home with WordPress.com. The
        backend is just a slightly simpler version, with most of the customization options removed. Put an afternoon
        into it, and you'll easily have a full blog up and running—though it will certainly look more generic than the
        one you can set up with a self-hosted WordPress install.

        If you want the WordPress experience (or at least everything but the customization) without all the hassle of
        self-hosting, then WordPress.com is a great option. It's super quick to get a simple blog started for free.

        WordPress.com price: Free plan available; Premium plans start at $9/month.</p>

    <h2 id="domain">Domain:</h2>
    <p>WordPress has been around since the early 2000s. Over the years, it's picked up a lot of new features, and it
        definitely has its quirks. Some people consider it bloated and based on out-of-date, or at least not-in-vogue,
        technologies. The open source community surrounding it certainly isn't drama-free either. All this led John
        O'Nolan, a former WordPress developer, to create Ghost roughly a decade ago.

        Ghost is designed to be a powerful, hassle-free blogging and audience management platform, especially for
        subscription-based publications. It's a bit more focused on blogging and publishing other content like
        newsletters than WordPress, which, after years of development, has a lot of CMS DNA.

        Ghost has a similar business model to WordPress. The platform is free and open-source: anyone can download it
        and, provided they have the knowledge and resources to set up a server, run it for free. It's a little trickier
        to get off the ground than WordPress, as there are far fewer pre-configured options, but it's totally possible
        if you're determined. The developers also offer a hosted version, Ghost Pro, starting at $11/month. (Ghost is
        actually structured as a non-profit, so all the revenue from Ghost Pro is put back into developing the open
        source software.)

        While Ghost started out as a pure blogging platform, it's leaned into the paid newsletter and community boom
        over the past couple of years. Think of it as a blog-based Patreon and Substack competitor. While you can easily
        turn off or ignore any of the subscription and membership features, if you want to charge people for access to
        premium posts, a weekly newsletter, and other extra content, the options are there. It's also a big factor in
        the pricing structure: the cheapest Ghost Pro plan is limited to 500 members, but essentially unlimited people
        can visit your site and read your free blog posts.

        If you want something that's a bit more focused, Ghost is a great alternative to WordPress. Even if you don't
        want to use the membership features, you're still ignoring less of the platform and options than you are with
        WordPress if you're just trying to run a blog. Ghost—once you have it running or pay for Ghost Pro—offers a
        simpler experience overall, though you lose out on the raw freedom to add whatever features you want to your
        site. Still, a lot of things like SEO management and memberships that are available with plugins for WordPress
        come as standard with Ghost, so the relative lack of extensibility is unlikely to be an issue unless you're
        looking to build something truly custom.</p>

    <h2>Wix</h2>
    <p>Most website builders make for a pretty poor blogging experience. They either tuck the blog tools away in some
        weird subsection, are just awful to use, or both. Wix is the exception. Not only is it easy to build a website
        with it, but setting up a blog—and most importantly, posting to your blog—is just as simple.

        When you start a site with Wix, you're asked to describe what you're trying to build. If you use the word
        "blog," the AI site builder will literally add a blog. It's that simple.

        Unfortunately, Wix's hard pivot to AI comes with a few quirks. For one, your blog will be pre-populated with
        some AI-generated examples, and the blog editor includes AI tools that it suggests can write your blog posts for
        you. I wouldn't recommend using these if you're serious about creating an authentic blog—though the tools that
        suggest headlines or help with SEO metadata can be handy. But ignoring the AI stuff, Wix's blog editor is solid
        and easy to do all the usual bloggy-things with.

        Really, Wix is a great option for two kinds of people: those that want an even easier WordPress alternative, and
        those that want to build a full website where a blog is just one part of things.

        WordPress has its quirks, and if you aren't tech-savvy, it can be tricky to get things set up exactly how you
        want. Wix's website builder is a lot easier to configure than installing WordPress themes and plugins. The catch
        is that you can get a WordPress blog set up with a custom domain for a couple of dollars a month; for similar
        features, you're looking at least at Wix's $17/month Light plan. If you're running a business, that might not be
        a big deal, but if you're starting a personal blog, the price can add up.

        Similarly, while millions of people have built full websites using WordPress, Wix makes it simpler. If you want
        an online store, web bookings, or even just a big website, Wix's easier-to-use tools may make for a more
        pleasant experience—especially if you're looking at paying for managed WordPress hosting anyway.</p>


    <h2>Standout:</h2>
    <p>Blogger isn't a standout blogging platform in terms of features. Even after an update in 2020, the interface is
        pretty stripped back, the built-in themes aren't stellar, and you can't customize things like the post
        structure. The post editor, for example, mimics an even uglier version of Google Docs—which just doesn't make
        for a great blogging experience. I'm shocked Google hasn't killed it yet.

        Really, it's impossible to recommend, except that Blogger has one key feature that keeps it on this list: you
        can use a domain you already own, for free. With WordPress.com, on the other hand, unless you pay $4/month,
        you're stuck with a blogname.wordpress.com URL.

        Sign in to Blogger with your Google account, and create your first blog by clicking New Blog. Give it a name,
        and pick a theme. Then, click Settings in the sidebar, and under Publishing, select Custom Domain to add your
        custom domain name. Unfortunately, you can't buy one through Google anymore, so you'll need to configure things
        yourself with your domain registrar.

        If you have a domain already and want to use it with your blog without any additional costs, or you just need
        somewhere to park a domain name so that it stays live, then Blogger is the service for you. But if you're
        looking for a more customizable blog that's under more active development, go with one of the other options.

        Blogger price: Free, including using your own custom domain.</p>
